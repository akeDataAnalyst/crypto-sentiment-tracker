Ethereum Price Analysis: [&#8230;]","<p>Ethereum’s most recent price action reflects a temporary slowdown in momentum. After the aggressive decline toward the lower demand region, the market has entered a fluctuation phase, with minor bullish retracements attempting to stabilize the structure. The price is currently compressing within key technical boundaries, suggesting that a decisive move is approaching.</p>
<h2>Ethereum Price Analysis: The Daily Chart</h2>
<p>On the daily timeframe, ETH is moving in a consolidation phase following its sharp drop into the $1,800–$1,850 demand zone. The recent candles show minor bullish retracements, but these moves lack strong impulsive characteristics and appear corrective in nature.</p>
<p>Technically, the asset is confined between the $1.8K static support and the descending channel’s middle boundary, which is acting as dynamic resistance around the $2,500–$2,600 region. As long as Ethereum remains trapped between these two levels, the market structure reflects a fluctuation state rather than a confirmed trend reversal.</p>
<p>A valid breakout above the channel’s midline resistance would be required to shift short-term momentum in favor of buyers. Conversely, a breakdown below the $1,800 support would expose lower demand zones and likely reintroduce strong selling pressure.</p>

<h2>ETH/USDT 4-Hour Chart</h2>
<p>Zooming into the 4-hour timeframe, the price action reveals the formation of a tightening triangle pattern after the rebound from the $1,800 low. The structure shows converging trendlines, reflecting decreasing volatility and a balance between buyers and sellers.</p>
<p>Ethereum is now trading near the apex of this narrow range, indicating that a breakout is imminent. A bullish breakout above the upper boundary of the triangle could trigger a push toward the $2,300–$2,400 region as the next short-term resistance. On the other hand, a bearish breakdown below the ascending support of the triangle would likely lead to a renewed test of the $1,800 demand zone.</p>
<p>Overall, the market is in compression mode on the lower timeframe, and the next impulsive move will likely determine the short-term direction.</p>

<h2>Sentiment Analysis</h2>
<p>From an on-chain perspective, the Coinbase Premium Index has remained predominantly negative, indicating relatively weak demand from US-based investors and a lack of aggressive spot buying on Coinbase compared to other exchanges. This persistent negative reading aligns with the broader corrective structure observed on the charts.</p>
<p>However, the index has recently experienced a noticeable upward surge. Although it is still below the neutral threshold, the intensity of the rebound suggests that selling pressure from US participants may be easing. If this upward momentum continues and the index crosses into positive territory, turning green, it would signal renewed spot demand from US investors.</p>
<p>Such a shift could act as a catalyst for a bullish rebound, particularly if it coincides with a technical breakout from the current triangle formation. In that scenario, both technical structure and on-chain demand would align in favor of a stronger recovery phase.</p>

CryptoPotato,Shiba Inu (SHIB) Could Explode by 50% But Under This Vital Condition,https://cryptopotato.com/shiba-inu-shib-could-explode-by-50-but-under-this-vital-condition/,2026-02-16 13:21:38,Is SHIB gearing up for a move toward $0.0000099?,"<p>Shiba Inu (SHIB) has been on an evident downtrend in the past several months, reflecting a broader cooling of enthusiasm among traders and investors.</p>
<p>However, one popular analyst believes the meme coin has a chance to post a substantial price increase in the near future.</p>
<h2>What Needs to Happen?</h2>
<p>SHIB saw a strong rebound over the weekend, climbing to $0.0000072, the highest point since late January. Its rise <span style=""margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"">coincided with a broader meme coin upswing <a href=""https://cryptopotato.com/is-elon-musk-behind-dogecoins-latest-double-digit-surge/"">triggered</a> by news that X will soon allow users to </span>trade stocks and cryptocurrencies directly from their timelines.</p>
<p>SHIB&#8217;s revival was short-lived, and it is currently worth around $0.000006596, representing a 3% decline over the past 24 hours. According to renowned analyst Ali Martinez, however, the asset may be poised for another jump.</p>
<p>He <a href=""https://x.com/alicharts/status/2023216510328799288"">noted</a> that SHIB has been pressing against the $0.0000067 resistance level. Should the token flip this area into support, Martinez believes it could open the door to a 50% rally to $0.0000099. Many X users who engaged with the post agreed with this potential scenario. Global Rashid, for instance, <a href=""https://x.com/globalrashid007/status/2023241624977830197"">said</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;SHIB sitting right at decision time. Reclaim $0.0000067 as support and momentum shifts fast towards $0.0000099. Lose it, and this stays a range. Structure &gt; hype.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Some indicators point toward the possibility of a short-term rally. Shiba Inu&#8217;s burn rate has soared by 70% on a daily scale, resulting in more than three million tokens sent to a null address. While the USD equivalent of the destroyed stash is negligible, sustained efforts in that field can support price appreciation (especially if demand doesn&#8217;t decline).</p>

<p>SHIB&#8217;s exchange reserves are also worth observing. Recently, the number of coins stored on centralized platforms fell to a new five-year low, signaling that investors continue to shift toward self-custody, thereby reducing immediate selling pressure.</p>
<figure class=""wp-caption aligncenter"" id=""attachment_1428914"" style=""width: 1521px;""><a href=""https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/SHIB-Exchange-Reserves-1-1.png""><img alt=""SHIB Exchange Reserves"" class=""wp-image-1428914 size-full"" height=""762"" src=""https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/SHIB-Exchange-Reserves-1-1.png"" width=""1521"" /></a><figcaption class=""wp-caption-text"" id=""caption-attachment-1428914"">SHIB Exchange Reserves, Source: CryptoQuant</figcaption></figure>
<h2>The Doom Scenario?</h2>
<p>Ali Martinez has been quite vocal about SHIB lately and, last week, <a href=""https://cryptopotato.com/shiba-inu-shib-plunges-by-20-in-2-weeks-another-80-crash-comes-next/"">outlined</a> a completely different prediction. At the time, the price of the meme coin dipped well below $0.00000667, and the analyst viewed this as a precursor to a severe 80% decline.</p>
<p>Another element suggesting that a sustainable rally for the meme coin is far-fetched is the fading interest from market participants. SHIB has generated trading volume of just $167 million over the past 24 hours, a figure that pales in comparison to activity seen in other popular altcoins, including Dogecoin (DOGE), Ripple (XRP), Solana (SOL), Cardano (ADA), and many more.</p>
<p>Shibarium&#8217;s stalled progress is another worrying factor. Shiba Inu&#8217;s layer-2 blockchain solution <span style=""margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"">was <a href=""https://cryptopotato.com/shiba-inus-shibarium-officially-live-but-shib-price-suffers/"">launched </a>in the summer of 2023 and is designed to foster ecosystem growth</span> by reducing transaction fees, improving speed, and enhancing scalability. At one point, daily transactions on the protocol were in the millions, but data <a href=""https://shibariumscan.io/"">show</a> that activity has dropped to zero over the last few weeks.</p>
<p>Shibarium&#8217;s downfall appears to have begun in September last year, when its security was <a href=""https://cryptopotato.com/shib-army-alert-shiba-inu-team-explains-security-breach-are-funds-safe/"">breached</a>. Several reports claimed that the attack was carried out using a flash loan to purchase 4.6 million BONE tokens. LUCIE (the pseudonymous marketing strategist for Shibarium) refused to characterize the incident as a hack and assured investors that their funds were safe.</p>

This prompted many analysts to speculate about another rally from the asset, perhaps to and beyond $2.00.</p>
<p>However, the following several hours <a href=""https://cryptopotato.com/xrp-on-fire-analysts-call-for-another-big-move-after-16-surge/"">showed</a> that this was another fakeout as XRP tumbled to under $1.50, thus erasing almost all weekend gains.</p>
<p>According to a couple of prominent crypto analysts, the asset&#8217;s instant surge to $1.65 and its inability to close higher the weekly candle meant that it has printed a gravestone doji.</p>
<p>This is a technical term that suggests the formation of a bearish reversal candlestick pattern, indicating that the bullish momentum has faded. It&#8217;s often succeeded by a more profound price decline.</p>
<p>Ali Martinez, one of the analysts who spoke about the meaning of the gravestone doji, noted that the last time XRP had charted it, its price tumbled by 46% in just a few weeks. If something similar is to transpire now, XRP could lose the coveted $1.00 support and head toward $0.80.</p>

<p>Most altcoins have turned red as well, with ETH going below $2,000 and XRP plummeting beneath $1.50. Dogecoin is among the worst performers in the past 24 hours.</p>
<h2>BTC Rally Stopped Above $70K</h2>
<p>The primary cryptocurrency went through some enhanced volatility at the start of the current month, mostly downward. The culmination took place on February 6, when it plunged to a 15-month low at $60,000 after <a href=""https://cryptopotato.com/binance-buys-1b-in-bitcoin-us-inflation-lower-than-expected-but-btc-price-still-suffers-weekly-crypto-recap/"">losing</a> $30,000 in just under two weeks.</p>
<p>Then came the bounce-off as BTC rocketed by $12,000 to $72,000. It was stopped there and spent the following few days trading sideways between $72,000 that $68,000. The lower boundary gave in mid-week, and bitcoin slipped to under $66,000.</p>
<p>The bulls finally stepped up after this point and helped prevent another leg down. Just the opposite, BTC started to gain traction at the end of the business week and jumped to over $69,000. It <a href=""https://cryptopotato.com/pi-networks-pi-steals-the-show-as-bitcoin-btc-reclaims-70k-weekend-watch/"">continued to climb</a> above $70,000 on Saturday and Sunday before it was stopped there and driven to $68,000 on Sunday evening.</p>
<p>It has recovered some ground since then, but still trades below $69,000 as of press time. Its market cap is down to $1.375 trillion on CG, while its dominance over the alts stands still at 56.6%.</p>

<h2>Alts Heading South</h2>

DOGE was the top gainer yesterday from the larger-caps, but it&#8217;s now down to $0.10 after a 9% daily drop.</p>
<p>Other big losers over the past day include XMR, ZEC, WLFI, and MNT. Pi Network&#8217;s native token has also faced a violent rejection. It was <a href=""https://cryptopotato.com/pi-network-pioneers-celebrate-pis-35-daily-surge-as-important-deadline-approaches/"">stopped</a> at over $0.20 yesterday and is now down to just over $0.17 on CoinGecko.</p>
<p>The total crypto market cap has lost $70 billion in a day and is down to $2.425 trillion on CG.</p>

<p>GugaOnChain’s analysis was backed by experts at XWIN Research, who <a href=""https://cryptoquant.com/insights/quicktake/69921d87c876a02133a04362-Fear-and-Greed-Index-Signals-Extreme-Fear-%E2%80%94-Behavioral-Finance-Perspective-on-Cu"">noted</a> that the recent reading of 8 on the Fear and Greed Index was one that has rarely been seen, only appearing in previous stress events, including the 2018 bear market bottom, the March 2020 COVID crash, and the FTX collapse in November 2022.</p>
<p>The analysts pointed out that from a behavioral finance perspective, this reflects loss aversion and herd behavior, with investors reducing risk exposure after significant losses.</p>
<p>Looking at the quarterly price performance, it stands at -25.8%, with GugaOnChain seeing little prospect for recovery before Q2 2026. Additionally, spot Bitcoin ETF flows tell a similar story of institutional exhaustion. Since the start of the month, the products have seen net outflows of $2.17 billion, with the exodus accelerating as prices tumbled toward $60,000 on February 6.</p>
<h2>Price Action Reflects Volatility</h2>
<p>Other recent research provides context for the conditions described above. For instance, analytics firm Santiment <a href=""https://cryptopotato.com/bitcoin-shorts-hit-august-2024-levels-as-funding-rates-sink-deeply-negative/"">reported</a> that funding rates across exchanges had turned deeply negative, meaning traders were heavily positioned for price drops.</p>
<p>BTC’s price movement is reflecting the tension, with data from CoinGecko showing the asset had fallen about 3% in the last seven days, 10% over two weeks, and 28% across the past month, while trading roughly 46% below its October 2025 all-time high when it went past $126,000.</p>
<p>The growth contraction extends beyond Bitcoin itself, with GugaOnChain’s analysis showing the broader crypto economy shrinking, as mid-cap and small-cap altcoins contracted by 18.3% while the growth rate of the top 20 assets folded by -12.48%.</p>
<p>However, even with prices collapsing, demand from accumulator addresses has stayed strong at 380,104 BTC over the last 30 days. Furthermore, miners appear to be holding their BTC rather than selling, with their operations supported in part by AI revenue streams.</p>
<p>Taken all together, the conditions described in GugaOnChain’s assessment frame the current phase as one defined by fear, defensive positioning, and selective accumulation with little broad market confidence. According to them, “the turn toward recovery now depends on investor resilience.”</p>

<p>VALR, Africa&#8217;s largest crypto exchange by trade volume, concluded its role as a Gold Sponsor at the Africa Tech Summit in Nairobi on 11–12 February 2026. The event underscored Africa&#8217;s growing prominence as a centre for crypto innovation and adoption.</p>
<p>Africa&#8217;s financial landscape remains fragmented, with 54 countries and multiple national currencies in use. Cross-border payments continue to face high costs, often averaging around 7-8% for remittances according to sources such as the World Bank and industry reports from 2025, and delays of several days via traditional systems. Inflation averaged above 13% across the continent in 2025, according to the African Development Bank&#8217;s Macroeconomic Performance and Outlook Update from November 2025. These factors limit access to relatively stable foreign currencies such as the US dollar and encourage the use of alternatives for value preservation and efficient transactions.</p>
<p>Crypto adoption has accelerated in response. Sub-Saharan Africa recorded 52% year-over-year growth in crypto activity through mid-2025, according to Chainalysis&#8217; 2025 Global Crypto Adoption Index and Geography of Cryptocurrency Report. Stablecoins such as USDT and USDC play a prominent role in transaction volumes in the region, supporting practical applications including hedging inflation, remittances, and payments.</p>
<p>Countries including Nigeria, South Africa, Kenya, Ethiopia, and Ghana rank among the highest globally for crypto adoption, according to Chainalysis data. Nigeria leads Sub-Saharan Africa with over $92 billion in transaction value in the 12 months to mid-2025, followed by South Africa. Africa accounts for only about 3% of global trade volumes, yet these markets demonstrate leadership in applying crypto to real-world challenges around accessibility, participation, and capital flows.</p>
<p>VALR has expanded rapidly over the past two years, establishing itself as Africa&#8217;s leading crypto exchange by trade volume. It offers the deepest ZAR-denominated crypto markets in the world and ranks among the largest minters of USDC globally. Licensed by South Africa’s Financial Sector Conduct Authority (FSCA) and with regulatory approval in Europe, VALR serves over 1.7 million registered users and 1,800 corporate and institutional clients.</p>
<p>Co-Founder and CEO Farzam Ehsani delivered a keynote speech on the VALR Stage. He addressed the need for the global financial system to reflect the fundamental oneness of humanity, with crypto well-positioned to play a key role in achieving this.</p>
<p>Reflecting on the summit, Ehsani said: “The Africa Tech Summit in Nairobi reinforced a clear message: “Africa is not merely adopting crypto but leading its practical application to solve pressing financial needs. We are optimistic about the continent&#8217;s future and the role of unified, inclusive finance globally. VALR remains committed to building infrastructure that bridges divides and advances this shared vision.”</p>
<p>Co-Founder and Chief Product Officer Badi Sudhakaran participated in a panel on crypto adoption in Africa. He emphasised that adoption stems from necessity, positioning the continent as a hub for innovation and real-world application.</p>
<p><strong>About VALR</strong></p>

Ripple Price Analysis: The Daily Chart [&#8230;]","<p>Ripple&#8217;s XRP has staged a sharp rebound after printing a local low near $1.10, but the broader structure remains fragile. The recent impulsive move higher has pushed the price back into a key supply area, creating a critical decision point between continuation and another rejection within the dominant downtrend.</p>
<h2>Ripple Price Analysis: The Daily Chart</h2>
<p>On the daily timeframe, XRP remains inside a well-defined descending channel, respecting the bearish structure despite the recent bounce. The sell-off accelerated toward the major demand zone around $1.10–$1.20, where buyers finally stepped in aggressively. This reaction confirms the significance of the $1.15 area as a strong higher-timeframe demand.</p>
<p>However, the rebound is now approaching the channel’s middle trendline , a prior breakdown region near $1.75–$1.85, which previously acted as support and has now flipped into resistance. As long as the asset remains below this $1.80 region, the broader bias stays corrective within a bearish trend. A daily close above $1.85 would open the path toward the next major supply at $2.40–$2.50, while rejection from this zone could send the price back toward $1.20 again.</p>

<h2>XRP/USDT 4-Hour Chart</h2>
<p>On the 4-hour timeframe, the recovery appears more impulsive, with strong bullish candles reclaiming the short-term supply area around $1.50–$1.55. The asset pushed into the $1.65–$1.80 region, which aligns with minor intraday supply and the lower boundary of the previous consolidation range. However, it was rejected there and brought back to its starting point.</p>
<p>If RP manages to stabilize above $1.55 and build a base between $1.55 and $1.70, a continuation toward $1.80 becomes likely. On the other hand, failure to hold above $1.55 could shift momentum back to the downside, exposing $1.30 first and then the key $1.15 demand again.</p>

Bitcoin Price Analysis: The Daily Chart On [&#8230;]","<p>Bitcoin’s recent bounce has pushed the market back toward the $70K–$72K area, but the broader structure remains fragile. The key question now is whether this rebound can evolve into a deeper corrective move toward overhead resistance, or if it is merely a temporary reaction within a dominant downtrend.</p>
<h2>Bitcoin Price Analysis: The Daily Chart</h2>
<p>On the daily timeframe, BTC remains inside a clear descending channel, preserving the overall bearish structure. The breakdown below the $75K level triggered an accelerated sell-off that extended directly into the $60K demand zone, where buyers finally stepped in.</p>
<p>The recent recovery has brought the price back toward $70K, which also aligns with the channel’s mid-boundary, making it a notable resistance. However, Bitcoin is still trading below the critical $75K resistance. As long as the market remains beneath the $75K-$80K region, the move is technically considered a corrective rebound within a broader bearish trend.</p>
<p>A decisive reclaim of $75K would expose $78,915 and then $81,485 (0.702) as the next upside targets. On the downside, the $60K zone remains the primary structural support.</p>
<p><a href=""https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/BTC-D-5.jpg""><img alt="""" class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-1428857"" height=""1325"" src=""https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/BTC-D-5.jpg"" width=""1952"" /></a></p>
<h2>BTC/USDT 4-Hour Chart</h2>
<p>On the 4-hour timeframe, the rebound from $60K appears impulsive, but the price is now approaching the $70K-$72K short-term resistance area, which aligns with the descending structure and previous breakdown region. The market is currently compressing below this level.</p>
<p>A confirmed break and consolidation above $72K would likely trigger continuation toward $75K crucial threshold. However, failure to clear this resistance could result in renewed downside pressure, targeting $65K first and potentially revisiting the $60K demand zone if selling momentum increases.</p>
<p><a href=""https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/BTC-4H-5.jpg""><img alt="""" class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-1428856"" height=""1325"" src=""https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/BTC-4H-5.jpg"" width=""1952"" /></a></p>
<h2>Sentiment Analysis</h2>
<p>The Bitcoin Futures Average Order Size chart reveals a notable shift during the recent decline. As the asset approached the $60,000–$65,000 region, several green dots appeared, representing large whale-sized orders entering the market. This cluster of green dots near the local bottom suggests that larger participants began accumulating during the panic-driven sell-off.</p>
<p>However, red dots has been apeared following the recent rebou, reflecting retail-driven activity. The recent whale participation at lower prices increases the probability that the $60K region attracted strategic accumulation rather than random buying, while the retail-driven rebound hints at a potential consolidation stage followed by bullish retracements.</p>
<p>If this whale activity returns around the $65K-$80K range, it strengthens the case for a sustained rebound. However, for the structure to shift meaningfully bullish, Bitcoin must reclaim $80K. Without that reclaim, the broader daily trend remains corrective within a bearish framework.</p>

CryptoPotato,3 Things That Could Influence Crypto and Bitcoin Prices This Week,https://cryptopotato.com/3-things-that-could-influence-crypto-and-bitcoin-prices-this-week/,2026-02-16 07:31:50,A short but busy week lies ahead on the United States economic calendar as spot crypto markets lose recent gains again.,"<p>All eyes will be on the PCE inflation report this week, following last week’s CPI, and the Federal Reserve minutes on Wednesday.</p>
<p>January’s CPI <a href=""https://cryptopotato.com/us-cpi-data-for-january-shows-cooling-inflation-how-will-bitcoins-price-react/"">came in</a> slightly below expectations, with headline inflation at 2.38% year-on-year and core CPI at 2.5%, the lowest since early 2021. This boosted the stock and crypto markets on Friday, but gains in the latter were soon eroded over the weekend.</p>
<blockquote><p>“Meanwhile, geopolitical tensions remain, and macroeconomic uncertainty is elevated,” said the Kobeissi Letter, cautioning of “more volatility this week.”</p></blockquote>
<h2>Economic Events Feb. 16 to 20</h2>
<p>Traditional markets are closed in the US on Monday for the President’s Day holiday.</p>
<p>There is an ADP employment update on Tuesday, followed by the January Retail Sales report. Wednesday sees more consumer spending data with the delayed December Durable Goods Orders numbers.</p>
<p>The Fed meeting minutes are also released on Wednesday, and there will be 10 central bank speaker events, which could shed light on future monetary policy decisions.</p>
<p>Investors will also get an early look at economic growth for the fourth quarter with the Thursday release of the GDP report.</p>
<p>However, the big data of the week is the December Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) inflation report.</p>
<p>Based on the January CPI data, Goldman Sachs raised its PCE outlook, <a href=""https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/economy/goldman-sachs-revises-pce-inflation-target-after-cpi-surprise/ar-AA1Wk4eA"">according</a> to reports.</p>
<blockquote><p>“We estimate that the core PCE price index rose 0.40% in January,” said economists.</p></blockquote>
<p>The growth projections were due to rising consumer electronics and IT prices, which are more heavily weighted in PCE than CPI. A global RAM and storage shortage due to AI data center demand has caused computer and component prices to surge.</p>
<blockquote><p>“So far, data doesn’t offer much reason for the Fed to cut rates at its next meeting in March,” wrote The Street.</p>
<p>The CME Fed Watch Tool has a 90% probability that rates will remain unchanged.</p></blockquote>
<h2>Crypto Market Outlook</h2>
<p>Crypto markets have lost last week’s late gains, with total capitalization dropping 2.5% over the past 24 hours in a fall back to $2.41 trillion.</p>
<p>Bitcoin failed to hold above $70,000 for <span style=""margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"">long and <a href=""https://cryptopotato.com/short-term-bitcoin-holders-in-pain-as-bear-market-deepens/"" target=""_blank"">retreated</a> to $68,300 in early Asian trading</span> on Monday. The asset has remained rangebound for the past ten days.</p>
<p>Ether prices have tanked hard, shedding 5% from almost $2,100 back to $1,950 at the time of writing, while the altcoins continue to bleed out.</p>

CryptoPotato,Crypto Flows to Human Trafficking Services Jump 85% to Hundreds of Millions in 2025,https://cryptopotato.com/crypto-flows-to-human-trafficking-services-jump-85-to-hundreds-of-millions-in-2025/,2026-02-15 22:07:55,"As Epstein-linked revelations emerged, new data show crypto payments to suspected trafficking services surged 85% globally in 2025.","<p>As global attention remains fixed on the continued release and scrutiny of emails and documents tied to sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein, attention has turned to how exploitation networks operate and move money.</p>
<p>Against this backdrop, a new report from Chainalysis disclosed that cryptocurrency flows to suspected human trafficking-related services surged sharply in 2025. Transaction volumes reached hundreds of millions of dollars, up 85% year-over-year. While the figures quantify financial activity, the report stressed that the true cost of these crimes is borne by victims, not balance sheets.</p>
<h2>Trafficking-Linked Crypto Activity</h2>
<p>The increase in crypto-linked trafficking activity has occurred alongside the expansion of Southeast Asia–based scam compounds, online gambling operations, and Chinese-language money laundering and guarantee networks, many of which operate openly on Telegram and form a tightly connected illicit ecosystem with global reach.</p>
<p>Unlike cash-based systems, blockchain transparency helps investigators to trace these flows, thereby creating opportunities to identify and disrupt networks that would otherwise remain hidden. Blockchain analytics company Chainalysis <a href=""https://www.chainalysis.com/blog/crypto-human-trafficking-2026/"">tracked</a> four primary categories of suspected cryptocurrency-facilitated trafficking: Telegram-based &#8220;international escort&#8221; services <a href=""https://cryptopotato.com/interpol-reports-over-60-countries-hit-by-human-trafficking-fueled-crypto-scams/"">suspected</a> of trafficking people; &#8220;labor placement&#8221; agents linked to kidnapping and forced labor in scam compounds; prostitution networks; and vendors of child sexual abuse material (CSAM).</p>
<p>Payment behavior differs across categories. &#8220;International escort&#8221; services and prostitution networks rely almost entirely on stablecoins as they prioritize price stability and ease of conversion, but CSAM vendors have historically favored Bitcoin. However, its dominance is declining as alternative Layer 1 networks and privacy tools emerge.</p>
<p>Escort services were found to be deeply integrated with Chinese-language money laundering networks that rapidly convert stablecoins into local currencies and reduce exposure to asset freezes by centralized issuers. Transaction-size analysis points to professionalized operations as nearly 49% of &#8220;international escort&#8221; service transfers surpass $10,000, which is consistent with organized enterprises operating at scale.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, prostitution networks cluster in the $1,000-$10,000 range. These networks often use structured pricing and customer-service models, advertising standardized rates across major East Asian cities, which in turn produce identifiable on-chain patterns useful for detection.</p>
<h2>CSAM Crypto Economy</h2>
<p>CSAM operations reveal a different structure. It was found that roughly half of transactions are under $100, and there is a shift toward subscription-based models that generate predictable revenue streams. In 2025, Chainalysis observed growing use of Monero and instant exchangers to launder CSAM proceeds, in addition to an emerging overlap between CSAM networks and sadistic online extremism communities, where abuse material is monetized through cryptocurrency payments.</p>
<p>One major CSAM site identified in July 2025 alone used more than 5,800 crypto addresses and generated over $530,000 since 2022. The report also stated that trafficking-linked services leverage US-based infrastructure for scale and legitimacy, while operators often remain overseas to limit personal exposure.</p>

CryptoPotato,PGI CEO Sentenced to 20 Years in $200M Bitcoin Ponzi Scheme,https://cryptopotato.com/pgi-ceo-sentenced-to-20-years-in-200m-bitcoin-ponzi-scheme/,2026-02-15 19:35:47,"PGI's CEO spent millions on luxury cars, homes, hotels, designer clothing, jewelry, and watches using investor funds.","<p>The US Department of Justice announced that Ramil Ventura Palafox, the CEO of Praetorian Group International (PGI), was sentenced to 20 years in prison.</p>
<p>Prosecutors stated that Palafox operated a $200 million Bitcoin-based Ponzi scheme that defrauded more than 90,000 investors across the world.</p>
<h2>Bitcoin Fraud Case</h2>
<p>According to court documents, Palafox, the 61-year-old dual citizen of the United States and the Philippines, owned and controlled PGI and served as its chairman, chief executive officer, and chief promoter. Prosecutors <a href=""https://www.justice.gov/usao-edva/pr/praetorian-group-international-ceo-sentenced-20-years-prison-200m-bitcoin-ponzi-scheme"">said</a> Palafox falsely claimed that PGI was engaged in Bitcoin trading and marketed the firm as a multi-level marketing investment opportunity. He promised investors daily returns ranging from 0.5% to 3%.</p>
<p>In reality, PGI was not trading Bitcoin at a scale capable of generating those returns, and investor payouts were funded using victims&#8217; own deposits or money from new investors. From December 2019 through October 2021, at least 90,000 investors invested more than $201 million in PGI, including approximately $30.3 million in fiat currency and at least 8,198 BTC, worth around $171.5 million at the time.</p>
<p>As a result of the scheme, investor losses rose to over $62 million. Court records reveal that Palafox created an online PGI portal that allowed investors to track what he represented as their investment performance. Between 2020 and 2021, the website consistently and fraudulently displayed gains, which led victims to believe their investments were profitable and secure.</p>
<h2>Luxury Cars, Mansions, and Lies</h2>
<p>Palafox spent roughly $3 million on 20 luxury vehicles, including models from Porsche, Lamborghini, McLaren, Ferrari, BMW, and Bentley. He also spent about $329,000 on penthouse suites at a luxury hotel chain and purchased four homes in Las Vegas and Los Angeles, estimated to be more than $6 million.</p>
<p>Additional spending included approximately $3 million on luxury clothing, watches, jewelry, and home furnishings from retailers such as Louboutin, Neiman Marcus, Gucci, Versace, Ferragamo, Valentino, Cartier, Rolex, and Hermès. Prosecutors said Palafox also transferred at least $800,000 in fiat currency and 100 BTC, which was then equivalent to $3.3 million, to a family member.</p>
<p>The Justice Department said PGI victims may be eligible for restitution.</p>
<p>Separately, PGI Global&#8217;s UK entity was <a href=""https://cryptopotato.com/uk-closes-crypto-platform-pgi-global-for-defrauding-investors-with-over-700000/"">shut</a> down by the United Kingdom High Court back in 2022. In April 2025, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) <a href=""https://cryptopotato.com/sec-drops-the-hammer-on-198-million-crypto-ponzi-scheme/"">charged</a> Palafox with orchestrating the massive Ponzi scheme.</p>

<p>The initial trading days were more than impressive, and a few more funds joined the Ripple fleet. However, the past week showed a rather worrying trend reversal.</p>
<h2>XRP ETFs&#8217; Demand Slows</h2>
<p>Canary Capital&#8217;s XRPC <span style=""margin: 0px; padding: 0px;""><a href=""https://cryptopotato.com/canarys-xrp-etf-xrpc-launch-successful-heres-what-happened-on-day-1/"" target=""_blank"">set a debut-day trading volume record</a> in 2025 on its November 13 launch and remains the market leader despite the launch of four additional</span> funds. It now holds more than $410 million in cumulative net inflows, followed by Bitwise&#8217;s XRP ($360 million) and Franklin Templeton&#8217;s XRPZ ($328 million).</p>
<p>The products went for over a month without a single red day in terms of net flows, and quickly surpassed the $1 billion mark. However, the green streak <a href=""https://cryptopotato.com/spot-xrp-etfs-record-green-streak-snapped-as-ripple-price-plunges-13-in-days/"">broke</a> on January 7, and there were a few more painful days since then, including January 20, and the worst &#8211; January 29.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, most full trading weeks ended in the green, with total net inflows stabilizing above $1.20 billion. The past week, though, showed little interest despite three days being in the green. The net inflows were $6.31 million on Monday, $3.26 million on Tuesday, and $4.5 million on Friday, shows data from SoSoValue.</p>
<p>Thursday was a red day, with a net withdrawal of $6.42 million, while Wednesday&#8217;s trading volume was absent, with $0.00 in flows. Although the week ended slightly in the green ($7.65 million), the total number and individual daily performance clearly show a declining demand.</p>

<h2>But XRP Price Rockets</h2>
<p>Despite the lack of interest in the ETFs, the underlying asset&#8217;s price went through some intense volatility, especially during the weekend. The token recovered from last week&#8217;s plunge to $1.11 but was rejected at $1.55 and spent most of the past several days sitting around $1.40.</p>
<p>The bulls went on the offensive in the past 48 hours, <a href=""https://cryptopotato.com/xrp-on-fire-analysts-call-for-another-big-move-after-16-surge/"">pushing</a> the cryptocurrency to a multi-week peak of just over $1.65 earlier today. Nevertheless, XRP was rejected once again there and now sits around $1.55 once more.</p>
<p>Despite the retracement, XRP&#8217;s market cap remains well above $90 billion, placing it north of BNB for the battle for the fourth place in terms of that metric.</p>

CryptoPotato,How High Can Ripple (XRP) Go Next Week? 4AIs Make Bullish Predictions,https://cryptopotato.com/how-high-can-ripple-xrp-go-next-week-4ais-make-shocking-predictions/,2026-02-15 16:02:44,Can XRP spike to $2 or beyond as early as next week?,"<p>While Ripple&#8217;s cross-border token crashed to almost $1.10 on February 6, bulls have since stepped in to stabilize the valuation, which currently trades around $1.55.</p>
<p>The question now is whether next week can deliver further gains and how high the price could go. Here&#8217;s what four of the most widely used AI-powered chatbots said on the matter.</p>
<h2>The Bulls</h2>
<p>ChatGPT estimated that the most probable outcome for the week ahead is for XRP to rise to roughly $1.60, which it did on Sunday, but has yet to reclaim that level. It claimed that a move north is much more plausible than a renewed crash, based on recent investor behavior.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;At the moment, XRP looks more like it&#8217;s in a stabilization phase rather than the beginning of a major breakout. The bounce from around $1.10 to $1.50 shows that buyers stepped in aggressively at lower levels, which is constructive. However, sharp rebounds are often followed by consolidation before any serious continuation higher,&#8221; its analysis reads.</p></blockquote>
<p>The chatbot projected that an explosion to as high as $2 next week is also possible, but it would depend heavily on a major catalyst, such as a solid revival of the broader crypto market or huge news concerning Ripple and its ecosystem.</p>
<p>Grok &#8211; the chatbot integrated within X &#8211; agreed with ChatGPT&#8217;s assumption that XPR is most likely to surge and maintain $1.60 next week. Nonetheless, it projected that such a scenario will only be possible if the price reclaims decisively the important zone of $1.40. Grok also envisioned a jump to as high as $1.80 but expects the rally to occur toward the end of February rather than in the following seven days.</p>
<p>Several indicators, including the declining amount of XRP held on the largest crypto exchange, Binance, and the formation of certain technical setups, <a href=""https://cryptopotato.com/is-xrp-ready-to-blast-off-3-signs-the-ripple-bulls-are-back/"">reinforce</a> the bullish thesis.</p>
<h2>The Bears</h2>
<p>Unlike the aforementioned chatbots, Perplexity is pessimistic about XRP&#8217;s performance next week and expects the price to decline. It outlined that investor sentiment has been quite depressing lately, predicting that the price may drop to as low as $1.24 in the coming days.</p>
<p>Google&#8217;s Gemini also envisioned a bearish tilt in the week ahead. It noted that February has historically been a challenging month for XRP, characterizing the $1.35 &#8211; $1.40 range as &#8220;the line in the sand.&#8221;</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;This level isn&#8217;t just a number &#8211; it&#8217;s the technical floor that has been holding the &#8216;February slide&#8217; together. XRP is hovering right on that edge, and if it plummets below this, it could open the door to a further plunge to as low as $1,&#8221; it concluded.</p></blockquote>

<p>The past few months, though, <a href=""https://cryptopotato.com/the-bear-market-signal-this-bitcoin-indicator-just-flashed-red-after-3-years/"">do not appear to be a regular correction</a>.

<blockquote><p>&#8220;Importantly, the $60K zone was a former breakout level during the 2025 rally, which now acts as critical support.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>If the cryptocurrency finds a solid support and stabilizes at these levels, as it has done in the past week, the move south could &#8220;resemble previous 50% resets seen during strong cycles,&#8221; said the AI. However, a breakdown below these levels could &#8220;strengthen the bear thesis significantly.&#8221;</p>
<p>In conclusion to this question, ChatGPT said that BTC is indeed in a bear market, at least by the definition of that phrase. The only thing that remains uncertain is the magnitude and duration.</p>
<h2>Where Is the Bottom?</h2>
<p>OpenAI&#8217;s platform believes there&#8217;s a 35% chance that the bottom was in at $60,000. However, its most likely scenario envisions at least one more leg down that could drive the cryptocurrency to $50,000-$52,000.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The $50K region represents a strong psychological level and prior consolidation zone. A move here would mark a roughly 60% drawdown from the all-time high, aligning with more severe but still cyclical corrections.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>ChatGPT also outlined two extreme cases, both of which it believes are highly unlikely &#8211; a capitulation crash to $40,000-$45,000 or a full-on investor exodus to under $35,000. Nevertheless, it explained that both of these scenarios would require a massive black swan event, such as FTX&#8217;s collapse or a new war.</p>
<h2>Will Bitcoin Endure?</h2>
<p>No matter which of the aforementioned scenarios materializes, ChatGPT remains positive on bitcoin&#8217;s long-term potential. It reminded that the asset has experienced and survived far worse drawdowns of up to 80% or even 90% in its early days.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The most realistic bottom range currently sits between $50K and $60K, with a deeper flush toward the low-$40Ks possible if macro conditions worsen. However, bitcoin has shown extreme resiliency in the past, and there&#8217;s not much evidence to suggest otherwise now.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

CryptoPotato,Ripple’s February Ledger Update: What It Means for XRP Investors and Prices,https://cryptopotato.com/ripples-feb-ledger-update-what-it-means-for-xrp-prices/,2026-02-15 12:05:58,Ripple Labs released a major update in Feb. regarding its XRP Ledger (XRPL). But will that be enough to save XRP’s price from Bitcoin’s stiff correction?,"<p>XRP is one of the most popular cryptocurrencies worldwide. Its market cap is neck-and-neck with BNB to rank number four by this metric.</p>
<p>Its main use case is fast, low-fee cross-border payments, but the XRP Ledger is opening up an entirely new use case for XRP tokens—decentralized finance (DeFi).</p>
<p>The <span style=""margin: 0px; padding: 0px;""><a href=""https://ripple.com/insights/institutional-defi-on-xrpl-scaling-real-world-finance-with-xrp-at-the-core/"" target=""_blank"">February update</a> from the official team at Ripple Labs signals a significant shift</span> in the ecosystem&#8217;s fortunes. But real quick, before diving into the update:</p>
<p>Here’s how XRP’s price reacted after Ripple released the update on these exciting new developments: on Friday, Feb. 13, XRP traded for a daily average price of $1.35 before it surged to over $1.65 on Sunday.</p>
<h2>“Institutional DeFi on XRPL”</h2>
<p>The Ripple Labs update teased “Institutional DeFi on XRPL,” in a headline that promised the network will scale real-world finance with XRP at the core. The key selling point for Ripple investors and developers in this announcement is that these updates make the XRP Ledger well-suited for institutional-grade players.</p>
<p>Serious financial firms with big clients in New York City and London can rely on this technology to better meet the needs of their business. Or at the very least, that&#8217;s what the XRP team states. The note opened with a quick TLDR; summary highlighting XRP’s utility in liquidity and credit markets as well as for payments.</p>
<p>This referred to On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) powered by Ripple. This platform feature allows large institutions or individuals moving large funds to send them via RippleNet using XRP tokens.</p>
<p>But the exciting updates included:</p>
<ul>
<li>MPT (fungible Multi-Purpose Tokens for RWA tokenization)</li>
<li>Permissioned Domains for access management</li>
<li>Lending Protocol for native on-ledger XRP credit markets</li>
<li>Confidential Transfers for institutional-grade privacy</li>
<li>Ripple support for foreign exchange (FX) markets</li>
</ul>
<p>Meanwhile, sophisticated new tools such as Credentials, Token Escrow, and Batch Transactions will help enterprise-grade clients stay compliant with financial regulators and automate on-chain workflows.</p>
<blockquote><p>“The foundation for the next generation of blockchain-based financial infrastructure is being built, with XRP as the backbone,” Ripple Labs said.</p></blockquote>
<h2>Fine-Tuning XRP Utility to Purpose</h2>
<p>In addition to the feature set for institutions, which forms the backbone of the next-generation XRP ecosystem on the ledger, Ripple also announced that XRPL now comes equipped with new developer tools to keep open development humming along.</p>
<p>Livenet Explorer is a developer tool that enables institutions and blockchain developers to visualize real-time on-chain activity, balances, and token flows. Meanwhile, XRPL Devnet Tools will help blockchain developers test features such as MPTs, escrow contracts, batch transactions, and lending protocols before deploying Dapps to the mainnet.</p>
<p>On the payments and FX side, permissioned domains will help build walled-off environments on the open blockchain with controlled credentials. Moreover, this can support KYC and AML tools for regulatory compliance.</p>
<p>XRPL is also getting ready to unlock balance sheets by optimizing collateral and capital velocity. This will be possible through token escrow for conditional settlement programmed right into XRP smart contracts.</p>
<p>One of Ripple&#8217;s big points in the February update is MPTs, or Multi-Purpose Tokens. Ripple says MPTs are the future of tokenization on XRPL. They can support sophisticated financial instruments such as bonds and funds while also handling metadata and parameters without requiring custom contracts.</p>
<h2>What It Means for XRP Prices</h2>
<p>For institutional and independent blockchain developers, here are some considerable developments. They may draw more participants and large financial firms into the XRP ecosystem.</p>
<p>But what does it mean for cryptocurrency investors?</p>
<p>During the week following the update announcement, XRP&#8217;s price outperformed the rest of the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market cap, indicating the market perceived the news positively.</p>
<p>However, as <em>CryptoPotato </em><a href=""https://cryptopotato.com/extreme-fud-persists-on-social-media-despite-btcs-60k-dip-recovery/"">reported</a>, the state of the industry is currently predominantly negative in terms of price action. As a matter of fact, the popular Fear and Greed Index tapped Extreme Fear territory with a score of just 5 a few days ago &#8211; the lowest in the last eight years. During times like these, good news does not move markets as much as it does in bull markets.</p>
<p>While the update is undoubtedly sound and important, it is unlikely to cause any significant price change, at least in the short term.</p>

CryptoPotato,Pi Network’s PI Steals the Show as Bitcoin (BTC) Reclaims $70K: Weekend Watch,https://cryptopotato.com/pi-networks-pi-steals-the-show-as-bitcoin-btc-reclaims-70k-weekend-watch/,2026-02-15 09:29:34,PI's recent rally has only intensified as the asset flew past $0.20 earlier today.,"<p>Bitcoin&#8217;s rather impressive and unexpected weekend recovery run has continued as the asset exceeded $70,000 earlier today and hasn&#8217;t looked back since.</p>
<p>Many altcoins have produced even more notable gains, including XRP and DOGE, both of which have skyrocketed by double digits. PEPE and PI joined that club.</p>
<h2>BTC Taps $70K</h2>
<p>It was just over a week ago &#8211; February 6, when the primary cryptocurrency&#8217;s crash culminated in a nosedive to $60,000. This became its lowest price tag in well over a year after a <a href=""https://cryptopotato.com/bitcoin-erases-post-trump-election-gains-altcoins-crash-by-double-digits-your-weekly-crypto-recap/"">$30,000 drop</a> in the span of approximately 10 days.</p>
<p>The bulls finally woke up at this point and didn&#8217;t allow another decline to the sub-$60,000 levels. Just the opposite, BTC <a href=""https://cryptopotato.com/bitcoins-rollercoaster-ride-continues-as-btc-price-recovers-10k-in-a-day/"">exploded</a> by $12,000 within a day and surged to $72,000, which turned out to be too strong a resistance.</p>
<p>The following few days were sluggish, with bitcoin trading between $68,000 and $72,000. The mid-week rejection at the upper boundary resulted in more pain, as the asset fell to $66,000 on Friday. However, it rebounded strongly in the following days, <a href=""https://cryptopotato.com/pi-networks-pi-finally-rebounds-sharply-bitcoin-btc-eyes-70k-weekend-watch/"">climbed</a> to $69,000 on Saturday and to $70,800 on Sunday. It faced some resistance there, but still trades above $70,000 as of press time.</p>
<p>Its market capitalization has risen to $1.410 trillion on CG, while its dominance over the alts has decreased slightly to 56.5%.</p>

<h2>PI, XRP, DOGE on the Run</h2>
<p>While some larger-cap altcoins, such as ETH, BNB, and TRX, have remained sluggish on a daily scale, others, such as XRP and DOGE, have gone on a tear. The OG meme coin has gained 18% daily, perhaps <a href=""https://cryptopotato.com/is-elon-musk-behind-dogecoins-latest-double-digit-surge/"">driven</a> by an announcement by Elon Musk, and now sits around $0.115. XRP has <a href=""https://cryptopotato.com/xrp-on-fire-analysts-call-for-another-big-move-after-16-surge/"">reclaimed</a> the $1.60 resistance after an 11% pump.</p>
<p>ADA, ZEC, and XLM are also in the green from the larger caps, while PEPE has soared by 25%. Pi Network&#8217;s native token became the top performer in the crypto markets today, <a href=""https://cryptopotato.com/pi-network-pioneers-celebrate-pis-35-daily-surge-as-important-deadline-approaches/"">surging</a> by over 35% at one point to over $0.20. Although it has lost some traction since then, it&#8217;s still up by 20%.</p>
<p>The total crypto market cap has added another $40 billion daily and is close to $2.5 trillion on CG.</p>

CryptoPotato,Pi Network Pioneers Celebrate PI’s 35% Daily Surge as Important Deadline Approaches,https://cryptopotato.com/pi-network-pioneers-celebrate-pis-35-daily-surge-as-important-deadline-approaches/,2026-02-15 08:40:34,The PI token has become the most substantial gainer over the past 24 hours.,"<p>What a volatile ride it has been for Pi Network&#8217;s native token after the calmness experienced during the December holidays. The asset was charting severe losses for several consecutive weeks, but the past few days have been a lot more positive.</p>
<p>This resurgance comes after the team issued an important reminder about a deadline for today.</p>
<h2>PI Rockets</h2>
<p>As mentioned above, PI was consistently one of the worst performers in the cryptocurrency markets ever since the last correction began in mid-January. The asset <a href=""https://cryptopotato.com/pi-networks-pi-crashed-to-new-atl-but-this-metric-signals-more-downside-ahead/"">marked</a> consecutive all-time lows, with the latest being at $0.1312 on February 11. As the community was <a href=""https://cryptopotato.com/7-years-waiting-pi-network-users-criticize-core-team-after-celebratory-post/"">lashing out</a> against the project behind it and there were calls for further decline, the trend reversed in the past few days.</p>
<p>PI&#8217;s price went on a wild run, gaining more than 30% in the past day alone, and over 55% since its all-time low seen just a few days ago. As such, it now trades above $0.20, which has prompted many Pioneers to <a href=""https://x.com/Koreanteacher1/status/2022939519776084029"">celebrate</a> the move and <a href=""https://x.com/Picoin__Pi/status/2022941913012470224"">call</a> for further gains.</p>
<figure class=""wp-caption aligncenter"" id=""attachment_1428833"" style=""width: 1266px;""><a href=""https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Screenshot-2026-02-15-103655.png""><img alt=""Pi Token Price on February 15.

<blockquote><p>&#8220;Huge congratulations to all Pioneers who recently DCA&#8217;d at the bottom around $0.13 &#8211; that decision is paying off nicely right now. A special shoutout and big thanks to PiBridge &#8211; a project that truly listens to the community and delivered one of the most useful features yet: USDT loans collateralized by PI. Thanks to this, anyone who urgently needed cash but didn&#8217;t want to sell their PI at the painful $0.13-$0.14 levels can now avoid massive regret,&#8221; <a href=""https://x.com/cryptoleakvn/status/2022814277850272247"">commented</a> Cryptoleakvn.</p></blockquote>
<p>It&#8217;s worth noting that today&#8217;s surge comes just a day after a popular crypto analyst, Captain Faibik, <a href=""https://cryptopotato.com/massive-500-pi-surge-forecast-as-pi-network-leadership-sends-key-message/"">said</a> they added PI to their portfolio and predicted a massive 500% surge.</p>
<h2>Deadline Approaches</h2>
<p>Separately, but perhaps somehow related to the recent pump, is the deadline ending today that concerns Pi Network&#8217;s &#8220;4th role&#8221; &#8211; Pi Nodes. As reported earlier this week, the Pi Mainnet blockchain protocol is undergoing a series of upgrades, and the deadline for the first one is February 15.</p>
<p>It requires all Mainnet nodes to complete this important step to remain connected to the network. <span style=""margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"">In this article, we <a href=""https://cryptopotato.com/pi-network-announces-major-upgrades-with-feb-15-deadline-what-pioneers-need-to-know/"" target=""_blank"">reiterated</a> the Core Team&#8217;s explanation that nodes must run on laptops or desktop computers, which would allow them to help power PI decentralization by validating transactions, strengthening network security, and supporting global consensus and trust.</span></p>

CryptoPotato,XRP on Fire: Analysts Call for Another Big Move After 16% Surge,https://cryptopotato.com/xrp-on-fire-analysts-call-for-another-big-move-after-16-surge/,2026-02-15 08:23:26,Ripple's XRP broke the weekend silence with a massive double-digit surge to over $1.65.,"<p>Unlike the weekend at the start of the month, in which the cryptocurrency market was hit hard, and multiple assets suffered massive losses, the past 24 hours have benefited almost all digital assets.</p>
<p>Ripple&#8217;s cross-border token has emerged as one of the top gainers, having surged by 16% daily to its highest price levels since February 1 at over $1.65.</p>
<p>CryptoWZRD weighed in on XRP&#8217;s performance during the weekend, indicating that both charts, against the USD and BTC, closed bullish. The analyst <a href=""https://x.com/cryptoWZRD_/status/2022855078650978449"">added</a> that &#8220;further upside from XRPBTC is very likely.&#8221;</p>
<p>Cobb, one of the most vocal XRP bulls on X who <a href=""https://cryptopotato.com/ripple-bulls-reveal-bold-price-predictions-as-xrp-surges-to-weekly-highs/"">made</a> some bold price predictions yesterday with double-digit targets, <a href=""https://x.com/Cobb_XRPL/status/2022912659172266410"">noted</a> that the cross-border asset might have started to decouple from other larger-cap cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p>This claim has merit at least in the past day. Aside from DOGE, which has <a href=""https://cryptopotato.com/is-elon-musk-behind-dogecoins-latest-double-digit-surge/"">soared</a> by over 20% since Saturday, XRP is the only other double-digit gainer from the top 20 alts.</p>
<p>ERGAG CRYPTO indicated that the current two-week candle, which is set to close later today, is &#8220;shaping into either a Hammer or a Dragonfly Doji.&#8221; The analyst explained that both options are classic reversal candles that appear after a severe downtrend.</p>
<p>XRP has indeed been in a downtrend for the past month and a half. The asset peaked at $2.40 on January 6 but was quickly halted there and pushed south to just over $1.10 on February 6. Nevertheless, it responded well to this calamity and now trades at $1.65, representing a near 50% surge from the local lows.</p>
<p>Consequently, ERGAG CRYPTO advised their followers to ignore the noise and focus on XRP&#8217;s structure, which &#8220;remains a bullish setup, until the market proves otherwise.&#8221;</p>

<p>Perhaps the most evident reason behind this rally could be, once again, Elon Musk. This time, though, he hasn&#8217;t made a specific DOGE-focused statement as in the past, but rather a broader promise for the entire crypto industry.</p>

<p>The beta platform is expected to launch within a month or two from X Money, the company&#8217;s in-house payments system.

<p>Given Musk&#8217;s <a href=""https://cryptopotato.com/dogecoin-spikes-14-on-latest-elon-musk-endorsement/"">history</a> with Dogecoin, it&#8217;s no wonder that the OG meme coin has gone on a tear ever since the announcement went live. The asset has consistently risen for the past few days, going from $0.095 to a two-week peak of over $0.115.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s worth noting, though, that the billionaire has been quite silent on the Dogecoin endorsement front in the past year or so after some controversial claims that <a href=""https://cryptopotato.com/major-win-for-elon-musk-in-258-billion-dogecoin-market-manipulation-lawsuit/"">led to lawsuits</a> against him.</p>
<p>Other meme coins have also benefited from the recent market resurgance. PEPE has skyrocketed by 30% daily, while PIPPIN has solidified its spot in the top 100 alts after another 16% surge. Moreover, the asset has rocketed by 270% in the past week.</p>

<p>The sentence follows Paxful&#8217;s admission that it conspired to promote illegal prostitution, violated the Bank Secrecy Act, and knowingly transmitted funds derived from criminal activity.</p>
<h2>Illicit Crypto Flows</h2>
<p>The penalty was determined based on the company&#8217;s ability to pay. Federal authorities said Paxful profited from facilitating transactions for criminals while promoting its lack of anti-money laundering (AML) controls and failing to comply with applicable money laundering laws, despite knowing that users on its platform were engaged in crimes including fraud, extortion, prostitution, commercial sex trafficking, romance scams, and human trafficking.</p>
<p>Court documents <a href=""https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/virtual-asset-trading-platform-sentenced-violating-travel-act-and-other-federal-criminal"">revealed</a> that Paxful operated an online virtual currency platform and money transmitting business where users traded cryptocurrency for cash, prepaid cards, gift cards, and other items. From January 1, 2017, to September 2, 2019, Paxful facilitated more than 26.7 million trades worth nearly $3 billion in total value and generated more than $29.7 million in revenue.</p>
<p>Authorities said Paxful knew that a portion of these transactions involved funds derived from criminal offenses, including fraud schemes and illegal prostitution. The company also deliberately transferred virtual currency on behalf of Backpage, an online advertising platform that later admitted in criminal proceedings that it advertised and profited from illegal prostitution, including content involving minors.</p>
<p>According to the Justice Department, Paxful&#8217;s founders referred internally to the &#8220;Backpage Effect,&#8221; which they credited with helping the platform grow. Between December 2015 and December 2022, Paxful&#8217;s dealings with Backpage and a similar website resulted in nearly $17 million worth of Bitcoin being transferred from Paxful wallets to those sites. From this, Paxful earned at least $2.7 million in profits.</p>
<p>The plea agreement states that from July 2015 to June 2019, Paxful marketed itself as a platform that did not require know-your-customer (KYC) information. It not only allowed users to trade without collecting sufficient KYC data but also provided third parties with AML policies that were not implemented or enforced, and failed to file suspicious activity reports despite clear indicators of criminal conduct.</p>
<h2>DOJ Cuts Penalty</h2>
<p>Paxful pleaded guilty to conspiring to violate the Travel Act by promoting illegal prostitution through interstate commerce, conspiring to operate an unlicensed money transmitting business, and conspiring to violate the Bank Secrecy Act&#8217;s AML requirements.</p>
<p>Although the parties agreed that the appropriate criminal penalty was $112.5 million, the department concluded Paxful could only pay $4 million as part of the resolution.</p>
<p>Paxful&#8217;s guilty plea was part of a coordinated resolution with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), and in July 2024, the company&#8217;s co-founder and former CTO, Artur Schaback, also <a href=""https://cryptopotato.com/paxful-co-founder-pleads-guilty-to-aml-program-failures/"">pleaded</a> guilty to related AML violations.</p>

CryptoPotato,SafeMoon Scandal Ends With 8-Year Sentence for Ex-CEO,https://cryptopotato.com/safemoon-scandal-ends-with-8-year-sentence-for-ex-ceo/,2026-02-14 19:48:02,Former SafeMoon CEO Braden Karony sentenced to 8 years for fraud tied to $9 million in misused liquidity funds.,"<p>Braden John Karony, SafeMoon’s former CEO, has been sentenced to 8 years in prison for his role in a multi-million dollar crypto fraud scheme.</p>
<p>U.S. District Judge Eric Komite handed out the judgment in a Brooklyn federal court after a jury convicted him in May 2025 following a three-week trial.</p>
<h2>Details of The Sentencing</h2>
<p>Court documents <a href=""https://www.justice.gov/usao-edny/pr/ceo-digital-asset-company-safemoon-sentenced-100-months-prison-multi-million-dollar"">show</a> that Karony was found guilty of conspiracy to commit securities fraud, wire fraud, and money laundering. As part of the ruling, he has been <a href=""https://cryptopotato.com/safemoon-ceo-braden-karony-found-guilty-of-fraud-and-money-laundering/"">ordered</a> to forfeit approximately $7.5 million, while the amount of restitution to victims will be determined at a later date. The jury also issued a verdict instructing the forfeiture of two residential properties.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, one of his co-conspirators, Thomas Smith, pleaded guilty in February 2025 and is awaiting sentencing, while Kyle Nagy remains at large.</p>
<blockquote><p>“Karony lied to investors from all walks of life—including military veterans and hard-working Americans—and defrauded thousands of victims in order to buy mansions, sports cars, and custom trucks,” said United States Attorney Joseph Nocella, Jr.</p></blockquote>
<p>FBI Assistant Director in Charge James C. Barnacle said the former executive abused his position and betrayed investors’ trust by stealing more than $9 million in cryptocurrency to finance a lavish lifestyle. The proceeds were used to purchase luxury vehicles and real estate, including a $2.2 million home in Utah, additional homes in Kansas, a $277,000 Audi R8 sports car, a Tesla, a custom Ford F-550, and Jeep Gladiator pickup trucks.</p>
<p>IRS-CI New York Special Agent in Charge Harry T. Chavis added that Karony carried out the scheme by exploiting his access to SafeMoon’s liquidity pool while attempting to conceal the transactions, which law enforcement eventually traced, exposing the scheme.</p>
<h2>Liquidity Pool Misrepresentations</h2>
<p>SafeMoon tokens were launched in March 2021 by the firm on a public blockchain, with each transaction automatically subject to a 10% tax that was split into two 5% tranches. One was meant to be reflected to holders in proportion to their holdings, increasing their token balances, while the remaining 5% was designated for its pools to boost market liquidity.</p>
<p>In the months following its debut, SafeMoon attracted millions of customers and reached a market capitalization exceeding $8 billion.</p>
<p>Prosecutors <a href=""https://cryptopotato.com/safemoon-sfm-founders-arrested-and-charged-by-u-s-government-for-defrauding-investors/"">claim</a> that Karony and his partners lied about important details of the company, including false statements that its reserves were locked and could not be used for personal reasons, that tokens would only be used for specific business purposes, that digital asset pairs would be added to the liquidity pool manually when trades occurred on certain exchanges, and that the developers were not using or trading SafeMoon for their own gain.</p>
<p>In reality, they retained access to the liquidity pools and diverted millions of dollars’ worth of crypto for personal enrichment.</p>

<p>The loss, which was largely driven by non-cash write-downs on the company’s crypto holdings and strategic investments, landed far below analyst expectations and reversed a $1.3 billion profit from the same period last year.</p>
<h2>Record Growth Metrics Masked by Portfolio Pain</h2>
<p>Coinbase’s shareholder letter, published after market close, <a href=""https://s27.q4cdn.com/397450999/files/doc_financials/2025/q4/Q4-25-Shareholder-Letter.pdf"">painted</a> two divergent pictures of its 2025 performance. On the operational side, the company logged all-time highs in total trading volume ($5.2 trillion, up 156% year-over-year), crypto trading market share (6.4%, double the year before), and subscription revenue.</p>
<p>In the letter, the crypto firm stated that paid Coinbase One subscribers have nearly hit 1 million and that it now has 12 products generating over $100 million in annualized revenue.</p>
<p>However, fourth-quarter financials told a different story, with total revenue falling 21.6% year-over-year to $1.78 billion and missing consensus estimates of about $1.83 billion. Additionally, transaction revenue, the company’s core fee business, dropped 36% from Q4 2024 to $983 million. Adjusted earnings per share of $0.66 also came in below analyst <a href=""https://x.com/martypartymusic/status/2022091312539836484?s=20"">forecasts</a>, which ranged from $0.86 to $0.96, according to market commentator MartyParty.</p>
<p>Per Coinbase’s report, the primary culprit behind the GAAP loss was a $718 million unrealized markdown on the exchange’s crypto investment portfolio, as Bitcoin (BTC) and other tokens declined in Q4.</p>
<p>The company also recorded a $395 million loss on strategic investments, including its stake in Circle, the issuer of USDC, which dropped approximately 40% quarter-over-quarter. Ultimately, Coinbase ended the year with $11.3 billion in cash and cash equivalents.</p>
<h2>Market Share Gains Face New Competitive Pressure</h2>
<p>Recent data suggests Coinbase is facing rising competition, with analytics firm Artemis <a href=""https://cryptopotato.com/hyperliquid-records-2-6t-volume-leaving-coinbase-behind-artemis/"">reporting</a> that decentralized derivatives platform Hyperliquid processed $2.6 trillion in trading volume, nearly double Coinbase’s $1.4 trillion in the same period. Artemis also reported a sharp divergence in market performance this year, with Hyperliquid’s token up 31.7% while Coinbase shares were down 27% over the same stretch.</p>
<p>The company’s mixed quarter follows a <a href=""https://cryptopotato.com/coinbase-2025-recap-lawsuit-win-europe-expansion-1b-in-btc-loans/"">busy</a> 2025, where it joined the S&amp;P 500, secured approval to operate across the European Union under MiCA rules, and completed major acquisitions, including Deribit. It also benefited from a legal win when the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) dropped a lawsuit against the firm.</p>
<p>Not all commentary has been positive, though, as shown by security researcher Taylor Monahan&#8217;s <a href=""https://cryptopotato.com/bring-more-lambs-researcher-slams-brian-armstrong-over-coinbase-security-failures/"">argument</a> that user protection on Coinbase is still lagging, citing more than $350 million in preventable losses during 2025.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, the exchange has maintained that its strategy focuses on diversification beyond spot trading. It said it is building an “Everything Exchange” that includes derivatives, equities, and prediction markets, and it recently partnered with Kalshi to support event-based contracts. Whether that broader model offsets swings in crypto prices will become clearer in the coming quarters.</p>

After a sharp decline toward the $1,750 demand zone, ETH has reacted with a moderate rebound, yet is expected to continue fluctuating in the short term.</p>
<h2>Ethereum Price Analysis: The Daily Chart</h2>
<p>On the daily chart, ETH continues to trade inside its descending channel, with lower highs and lower lows still intact. The recent impulsive drop pushed the price sharply into the $1.8K demand area, where buyers reacted and triggered a rebound toward the $2.1K region.</p>
<p>However, the asset remains below the 0.5 Fibonacci level at $2.4K and well under the 0.618 level at $2.5K, confirming that the current move is corrective rather than a confirmed trend reversal.</p>
<p>The $2.7K range, aligned with the 0.702–0.786 retracement levels, stands as a major supply zone and would be the key resistance area if a stronger recovery unfolds. As long as ETH remains below $2.5K, the broader structure favours sellers, while the $1.7K level remains the critical support to hold.</p>
<p><a href=""https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/ETH-D-4-scaled.jpg""><img alt="""" class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-1428819"" height=""1481"" src=""https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/ETH-D-4-scaled.jpg"" width=""2560"" /></a></p>
<h2>ETH/USDT 4-Hour Chart</h2>
<p>On the 4-hour chart, the price action has formed a short-term contracting structure after the sharp bounce from $1.7K. The market is currently fluctuating between the ascending short-term support trendline and the descending local resistance trendline, compressing near the $2.1K area. A successful break above $2.1K could open the path toward $2.5K, which is the next key resistance.</p>
<p>Conversely, losing the $2K intraday support would likely expose the $1.8K zone again. For now, ETH appears to be in a short-term consolidation phase between $1.8K and $2.1K following the recent volatility spike.</p>
<p><a href=""https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/ETH-4H-6-scaled.jpg""><img alt="""" class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-1428818"" height=""1481"" src=""https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/ETH-4H-6-scaled.jpg"" width=""2560"" /></a></p>
<h2>Sentiment Analysis</h2>
<p>The Ethereum Spot Average Order Size chart shows a notable increase in green dots during the recent decline toward the $1.8K region. These green clusters indicate large whale-sized spot orders entering the market as prices traded at low levels. This behaviour suggests potential accumulation by bigger players during the panic-driven sell-off.</p>
<p>While this does not immediately signal a trend reversal, the concentration of whale activity near $1.8K strengthens this zone as a structurally important demand area. If accumulation continues and price stabilises above $2K, the probability of a broader recovery toward higher resistance levels will gradually increase.</p>

CryptoPotato,"Bitcoin’s 50% Decline Seen as ‘Modest,’ Signals Market Maturity",https://cryptopotato.com/bitcoins-50-decline-seen-as-modest-signals-market-maturity/,2026-02-14 15:02:44,"Bitcoin’s 50% drop to $60K called modest by analysts, who say institutional flows show a maturing crypto market.","<p>Bitcoin (BTC) fell to about $60,000 on February 5 after sliding roughly 50% from its peak near $126,000, according to the latest market note from Binance’s research arm.</p>
<p>The report argues that, compared with prior cycles, the scale and structure of the decline suggest a market shaped more by institutional capital and macro forces than retail speculation.</p>
<h2>Drawdown Data and Macro Forces Shaping the Slide</h2>
<p>In a post published February 13, Binance Research <a href=""https://www.binance.com/en/research/analysis/weekly-market-commentary-2026-02-12/"">wrote</a> that the current 50% pullback “represents a modest correction relative to prior cycles,” noting that BTC has logged nine separate drawdowns of that magnitude or larger.</p>
<p>Historical examples listed by the firm include two separate falls of 94% in 2010 and 2011, a 78% dip between November 2021 and November 2022, and an 84% collapse during the 2017 to 2018 bear market.</p>
<p>The report attributed the present decline to macro conditions rather than crypto-specific failures, pointing to firm labor data and policy uncertainty tied to the Federal Reserve as factors that have kept liquidity tight and reduced appetite for risk assets. The researchers added that capital has rotated toward AI-linked equities and defensive sectors, leaving digital assets competing for investor attention.</p>
<p>Price data from CoinGecko shows Bitcoin trading less than 200 bucks below $67,000 at publication time, with the asset barely budging in 24 hours but gaining about 3% over the past week. Momentum is also weak across longer timeframes, with losses of about 19% in two weeks and nearly 30% in a month.</p>
<p>According to Binance Research, altcoins have lagged more sharply, with capital concentrating in large assets. The analysts linked that shift to a crowded token market after more than 11 million new tokens launched in 2025, many of which are no longer actively trading.</p>
<h2>Structural Signals Suggest a Different Cycle Profile</h2>
<p>Not all indicators paint the same picture, especially considering that analysis from Alphractal <a href=""https://cryptopotato.com/the-bear-market-signal-this-bitcoin-indicator-just-flashed-red-after-3-years/"">reported</a> that Bitcoin’s long-term Realized Cap Impulse has turned negative for the first time in three years. This is a signal that has historically coincided with extended downturns as capital inflows slowed. The firm’s founder, Joao Wedson, said institutional buying and ETF accumulation have not fully offset supply pressure.</p>
<p>Macro uncertainty may also be contributing, with data from CryptoQuant showing its Global Uncertainty Index at a record level, higher than readings during events such as the 2008 financial crisis and the COVID-19 period. Elevated uncertainty often leads investors to reduce exposure to volatile assets.</p>
<p>However, Binance’s researchers argue that structural participation has deepened. They cited steady assets under management in spot Bitcoin ETFs, stablecoin supply near cycle highs, and rising interest in tokenized real-world assets. One example came this week when BlackRock <a href=""https://cryptopotato.com/blackrocks-buidl-fund-hits-uniswap-as-uni-jumped-40/"">settled</a> trades for its tokenized Treasury fund through Uniswap infrastructure, a sign that traditional finance firms are still testing blockchain settlement rails.</p>

<p>The underlying asset has finally shown notable signs of recovery, prompting a prominent analyst to hint at buying PI and making bold price predictions.</p>
<h2>&#8220;Adding Some PI&#8221;</h2>
<p>Captain Faibik, a renowned cryptocurrency analyst with well over 100,000 followers on X, made a rare call on Pi Network&#8217;s native token. In a recent tweet, Faibik outlined their 500% surge expectation for PI after explaining that they had added some of the token for the midterm.</p>

<p></p>
<p>PI has performed rather well in the past day, jumping by 10% to over $0.16. This means the asset is now 23% higher than its all-time low of $0.1312, set on February 11. Despite this daily increase, PI remains deep in the red on almost all other scales, down nearly 95% from its all-time low recorded last February.</p>
<p>If Captain Faibik&#8217;s 500% surge prediction is to come true, the token could be on its way to $1. However, that seems unlikely at the moment, given the overall market environment and PI&#8217;s inability to stage a longer, more profound recovery.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a big elephant in the Pi Network room for the next few weeks. The token unlock schedule from PiScan indicates that, on average, more than 7.2 million PI will be released daily over the next month, but the number will frequently exceed 13.5 million by February 25. The unlocks will ease in March, though.</p>
<p>These large unlocking events are viewed as bearish, as they can increase immediate selling pressure from investors who have been waiting for their tokens for a long time.</p>

<p>Here are some of the biggest XRP price predictions, as well as some really mindblowing forecasts about the token&#8217;s role in global finance.</p>
<h2>Double Digits for XRP?</h2>
<p>The past 24 hours have been kinder to the cryptocurrency markets, with BTC <a href=""https://cryptopotato.com/pi-networks-pi-finally-rebounds-sharply-bitcoin-btc-eyes-70k-weekend-watch/"">going past</a> $70,000 for the first time in a week, and ETH reclaiming the $2,100 resistance. Ripple&#8217;s cross-border token has solidified its position as the fourth-largest cryptocurrency with a 7.5% surge to $1.48.</p>
<p>This has given the XRP Army wings to post some quite optimistic predictions once again, despite the token being 60% down from its all-time high of $3.65 marked in July last year.</p>
<p>Cobb alleged that the current price slump looks &#8220;so fake and orchestrated.&#8221; They <a href=""https://x.com/Cobb_XRPL/status/2022480176110530979"">added</a> that it could have the opposite effect and &#8220;end up being one of the greatest fakeouts of all time and then BOOM $10 out of nowhere.&#8221;</p>
<p>In a separate tweet responding to John Squire&#8217;s $10,000 prediction, Cobb noted that the &#8220;real XRP trenchers&#8221; are actually hoping for a more modest target of $10-$30. ChartNerd <a href=""https://x.com/ChartNerdTA/status/2022548037369725380"">agreed</a>, actually, saying that the 1.618 Fibonacci extension sees the token skyrocketing to $27.</p>
<blockquote class=""twitter-tweet"">

<p></p>
<p>Needless to say, even the lowest of the aforementioned targets &#8211; $10 &#8211; sounds more than just far-fetched at the moment. Despite XRP&#8217;s positive momentum in the past 24 hours, the asset would have to surge by 580% to reach $10 and by a whopping 1,950% to tap $30.</p>
<h2>XRP to Bridge Global Finance?</h2>
<p>But, for the sake of argument, let&#8217;s assume that XRP could indeed surge to $10 or beyond anytime soon. It would need some sort of a major catalyst, right? The SEC legal case conclusion and the hope of spot XRP ETFs in the US managed to send it to as high as $3.65, so there must be something big for a double-digit price target.</p>
<p>Squire, perhaps the most vocal bull within the XRP Army, made another shocking claim, saying the token &#8220;will become the bridge asset for global finance.&#8221; He believes banks won&#8217;t opt for BTC, and would go for XRP because of its speed, liquidity, and compliance.</p>
<blockquote class=""twitter-tweet"">

But, that could be a blessing in disguise.","<p>The past several months have been a consistent struggle for the primary cryptocurrency, which traded above $126,000 in early October &#8211; not that long ago.</p>
<p>However, it was rejected there, and the October 10 crash that <a href=""https://cryptopotato.com/bitcoin-crash-sparks-largest-liquidation-in-crypto-history-19b-gone-and-counting/"">wiped out</a> over $19 billion in leveraged positions started something that it seems hasn&#8217;t ended yet. Although bitcoin didn&#8217;t collapse below $100,000 at the time, it did so in November and hasn&#8217;t been within a six-digit price territory ever since.</p>
<p>It ended 2025 in the red, making it the first post-halving year to do so. Although it started 2026 on the right foot and neared $100,000 by the middle of January, it faltered there, and the subsequent rejection was more than just a healthy correction.</p>
<p>In the span of just a few weeks, the cryptocurrency plunged by almost $40,000 and <a href=""https://cryptopotato.com/2-6-billion-thursday-wipeout-what-triggered-the-latest-bitcoin-and-altcoin-crash/"">dumped</a> to $60,000 on February 6. This meant that the asset had crashed by more than 50% since its October all-time high.</p>
<p>Although this is a massive price calamity that brought down the entire market and the overall sentiment with it, especially in times when other financial industries were thriving, most people in a recent survey voted that the bottom is not actually in.</p>
<p>A poll by Ali Martinez shows that only 22.7% of the voters responded that $60,000 was the lowest BTC will ever go in this market cycle. The answer with the most votes &#8211; 30.4% &#8211; was actually $38,000, which, given bitcoin&#8217;s price of $70,000 now, would mean another near-50% crash.</p>

<p>Some recent reports <a href=""https://cryptopotato.com/the-bear-market-signal-this-bitcoin-indicator-just-flashed-red-after-3-years/"">agree</a> with the aforementioned results, indicating that the overall market structure has fundamentally changed and the bears are now in control. Analysts are split on trying to determine whether the bottom lies, but most believe it could be somewhere around $50,000.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Warren Buffett has repeatedly reasserted that investors should be greedy when others are fearful, and vice versa. Additionally, the analytics company Santiment has frequently <a href=""https://cryptopotato.com/is-this-the-moment-to-buy-bitcoin-as-btc-sentiment-sinks-to-fear/"">noted</a> that BTC typically moves in the opposite direction of the crowd&#8217;s expectations, so there might be a surprise rally hidden somewhere in this pile of fear.</p>

<p>The altcoin space is filled with notable gainers as well, with ETH surging toward $2,100, SOL going to $86, and XRP aiming at $1.45.</p>
<h2>BTC Eyes $70K</h2>
<p>After <a href=""https://cryptopotato.com/2-6-billion-thursday-wipeout-what-triggered-the-latest-bitcoin-and-altcoin-crash/"">dumping</a> to $60,000 on February 6, the primary cryptocurrency bounced off to $72,000 almost immediately but couldn&#8217;t penetrate that level and was sent south toward $68,000. The following several days were quite underwhelming as BTC spent them trading sideways between $68,000 and $72,000.</p>
<p>The upper boundary rejected the latest attempt on February 10, and bitcoin began to lose value rapidly, going down to $66,000 on February 12 and $65,000 on Friday morning. However, the bulls <a href=""https://cryptopotato.com/binance-buys-1b-in-bitcoin-us-inflation-lower-than-expected-but-btc-price-still-suffers-weekly-crypto-recap/"">managed to defend</a> that support and actually helped BTC reverse its trajectory.</p>
<p>They initiated a notable leg up that drove bitcoin to $68,000 $69,000 on Friday evening. After it stalled there for some hours, the bulls pushed the asset further to almost $70,000 on Saturday morning, but that resistance is yet to fall.</p>
<p>For now, bitcoin&#8217;s market cap has risen to $1.390 trillion on CG, while its dominance over the altcoins has remained relatively stable at 56.7%.</p>

<h2>Alts on the Rise</h2>
<p>Ethereum struggles mid-week as it dumped below $2,000 after the latest leg down. However, it reacted positively to this drop and now sits close to $2,100 after a 6% daily increase. XRP, which went down to $1.35 at one point, stands at $1.45 now after a similar daily increase.</p>
<p>Zcash is the biggest gainer from the larger-cap alts. ZEC has soared by 20% to $280, followed by HBAR (9%), BCH (8%), XLM (8%), and LINK (6%). SOL has shipped to $86 after a 7.3% daily jump.</p>
<p>Pi Network&#8217;s native token has finally shown some signs of revival. It&#8217;s up by 8% daily and 18% since its all-time low marked just three days ago, which prompted some analysts to <a href=""https://cryptopotato.com/pi-network-pi-jumps-8-in-24-hours-is-the-worst-over-or-another-dead-cat-bounce/"">speculate</a> whether this is a sustainable recovery or just another dead-cat bounce before a new plunge.</p>
<p>The total crypto market cap has added roughly $100 billion in a day and is up to $2.455 trillion on CG.</p>

This has propelled analysts to speculate that this is no longer a bull market correction; instead, the majority believes the bear phase has begun.</p>
<p>If that&#8217;s the case, then let&#8217;s see which altcoins between two of the most popular ones &#8211; XRP and ADA &#8211; can cope better under times of uncertainty, fear, and sell-offs.</p>
<h2>Narrative and Market Structure</h2>
<p>To gain further perspective on the matter from an unbiased analysis, we decided to touch upon perhaps the most widely utilized AI chatbot solution &#8211; ChatGPT. It began by acknowledging the fact that the narrative in crypto has shifted from &#8220;how high can this asset go&#8221; to &#8220;which altcoin is likely to lose less.&#8221;</p>
<p>When it came to comparing the two altcoins in question, the AI platform outlined several categories in which either one can outshine the other. In market structure and liquidity, it noted that XRP typically benefits from deep exchange liquidity, high derivatives activity, and strong global trading presence.</p>
<p>Although ADA also has strong liquidity, it has historically shown higher volatility during drawdowns and has been more aggressively sold by retail investors. As such, this point went for Ripple&#8217;s cross-border token, which actually took the second win as well, dubbed &#8220;narrative resilience.&#8221;</p>
<p>ChatGPT noted that XRP&#8217;s value proposition revolves around cross-border payments, institutional rails, and regulatory positioning, while ADA&#8217;s thesis centers on smart contracts, ecosystem development, and long-term infrastructure growth.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;During bear cycles, institutional and regulatory narratives often carry more defensive weight than ecosystem growth promises, especially when speculative activity declines,&#8221; it added.</p></blockquote>
<h2>Community and Historical Performance</h2>
<p>The last two categories mentioned in the subheading above also had the same winner. ChatGPT said ADA has historically experienced more extreme percentage declines from cycle tops, while XRP &#8220;tends to consolidate in tighter ranges during late-stage bear phases.&#8221;</p>
<p>In terms of community and holder behavior, ChatGPT&#8217;s answer was less obvious. It admitted that both have strong and vocal communities, but &#8220;ADA&#8217;s retail-heavy base can amplify panic selling.&#8221;</p>
<p>In contrast, XRP&#8217;s holder base has historically shown &#8220;stronger long-term holding behavior during legal and regulatory uncertainty periods.&#8221;</p>
<p>Consequently, OpenAI&#8217;s platform determined the following in a confirmed bear market:</p>
<ul>
<li>XRP is slightly more likely to show resilience</li>
<li>ADA could face deeper volatility and sharper pecentage drawdowns</li>
</ul>
<p>However, it warned that if BTC continues to trend lower, neither of the aforementioned altcoins is immune to additional double-digit percentage declines.</p>

CryptoPotato,Valentine’s Day Romance Scams: US Prosecutors Warn on Crypto Risks,https://cryptopotato.com/valentines-day-romance-scams-us-prosecutors-warn-on-crypto-risks/,2026-02-14 04:41:23,U.S. prosecutors have warned of Valentine’s Day romance scams using crypto after cases cost victims millions.,"<p>Prosecutors in the U.S. state of Ohio have issued a public warning urging Americans to watch for romance scams tied to cryptocurrency as they celebrate Valentine’s Day.</p>
<p>The alert drew attention to a rise in emotionally driven fraud cases where victims are persuaded to send digital assets after forming online relationships.</p>
<h2>Federal Warning Outlines Latest Tactics</h2>
<p>The U.S. Attorney&#8217;s Office for the Northern District of Ohio <a href=""https://www.justice.gov/usao-ndoh/pr/cupid-doesnt-ask-crypto-us-attorneys-office-warns-public-about-romance-scams-ahead"">said</a> criminals often approach targets through dating apps, social platforms, or text messages, then build trust for weeks or months before requesting money for fabricated emergencies or investments.</p>
<p>According to U.S. Attorney David M. Toepfer, scammers “prey on trust and emotion,” and they “are not looking for love—they are looking for money.” He added that such criminals often focus on older adults and emotionally vulnerable individuals.</p>
<p>His office also cited recent prosecutions and investigations, including a December 2025 case where authorities <a href=""https://www.justice.gov/usao-ndoh/pr/ghanaian-national-charged-running-romance-scams-took-over-8-million-elderly-victims"">charged</a> Frederick Kumi, a Ghanaian national accused of helping run a romance fraud network that allegedly took more than $8 million from elderly victims since 2023. Per investigators, the group used AI tools to create false identities and maintain convincing conversations before requesting money. Kumi was arrested in Ghana and is facing charges including wire fraud conspiracy and money laundering conspiracy.</p>
<p>Another case involved an Ohio woman who <a href=""https://www.justice.gov/usao-ndoh/pr/ohio-woman-loses-life-savings-cryptocurrency-investment-scam"">lost</a> about $663,000 after a stranger contacted her through a “wrong number” text. The fraudster later guided her through opening accounts on Crypto.com and Coinbase, then convinced her to transfer funds to a fake investment platform.</p>
<p>Fortunately, detectives from the FBI traced part of the stolen money to cryptocurrency wallets and seized more than $8.2 million in USDT with help from Tether.</p>
<h2>Data Shows Wider Trend in Crypto-Linked Fraud</h2>
<p>Recent industry research suggests these crimes fit a broader pattern, as shown in a January 2026 report from blockchain security firm PeckShield, which <a href=""https://cryptopotato.com/european-authorities-bust-815m-crypto-fraud-ring-arrest-nine-across-border/"">estimated</a> that crypto scams and hacks cost users more than $4 billion in 2025, with about $1.37 billion tied to scams alone.</p>
<p>The company said losses from scams rose about 64% from the previous year, often involving personalized impersonation tactics aimed at high-value targets.</p>
<p>The Ohio prosecutors have recommended several ways that people can protect themselves from romance tricksters, including reverse image searches on profile photos, skepticism toward anyone who refuses to meet in person, and a hard rule against sending cryptocurrency, gift cards, or wire transfers to people met online.</p>
<p>They also advised victims to preserve all communications and financial records, then file reports with the FBI’s Internet Crime Complaint Center. Additionally, the National Elder Fraud Hotline operates daily to guide older adults through the reporting process.</p>
<p>According to the officials, for those who may have sent crypto, time matters, since law enforcement can freeze stolen assets, but only if wallets are identified before funds move through mixers or overseas exchanges.</p>

CryptoPotato,"Classified Intel, Crypto Bets, and a Gag Order: Inside Israel’s Polymarket Security Scandal",https://cryptopotato.com/classified-intel-crypto-bets-and-a-gag-order-inside-israels-polymarket-security-scandal/,2026-02-13 21:43:51,Investigators say reservists accessed classified information through service and allegedly used it to bet on future military operations.,"<p>Israeli authorities have indicted an Israel Defense Forces (IDF) reservist and a civilian for allegedly using classified military information to place bets on the popular prediction market platform Polymarket.</p>
<p>According to The Times of Israel, Israeli authorities have indicted an IDF reservist and a civilian on suspicion of exploiting classified military information to place bets on the prediction market platform Polymarket.</p>
<h2>Use of Classified Information</h2>
<p>The indictments <a href=""https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/idf-reservist-and-civilian-indicted-for-using-classified-info-to-place-bets-on-polymarket/"">follow</a> a joint investigation by the Defense Ministry, the Shin Bet, and the Israel Police, which led to the arrest of several suspects, including additional reservists. Investigators allege that reservists used sensitive information they were exposed to through their military duties to make bets tied to future military developments.</p>
<p>Prosecutors have filed charges against one reservist and one civilian for what authorities described as severe security offenses, along with bribery and obstruction of justice. A court-issued gag order is currently in place, preventing the release of further details about the investigation, including operational specifics and the full scope of those questioned.</p>
<p>In a joint statement, the defense establishment warned that placing bets based on classified information creates a real and serious threat to IDF operations and to state security. The agencies added that such conduct is treated with the utmost severity and that authorities will act decisively against anyone involved in the unlawful use of secret material.</p>
<p>The case comes a month after the Shin Bet was examining suspicions that someone within the defense establishment had used classified information to bet on Polymarket. That report drew attention to a Polymarket account operating under the name &#8220;ricosuave666,&#8221; which placed several highly accurate bets in June 2025 related to Israeli military operations in Iran.</p>
<p>According to the report, the user bet tens of thousands of dollars and made an estimated profit of around $150,000.</p>
<h2>Market Manipulation Concerns</h2>
<p>Polymarket&#8217;s growing popularity has attracted both casual traders and high-profile participants. Among them is Vitalik Buterin, who recently <a href=""https://cryptopotato.com/vitalik-buterin-earns-70000-profit-on-polymarket-using-anti-irrationality-strategy/"">disclosed</a> earning about $70,000 last year on the platform by betting against outcomes he believes were highly irrational. Polymarket also hosted more lighthearted but widely shared bets, such as comparisons showing that the odds of <a href=""https://cryptopotato.com/bets-on-polymarket-show-bitcoin-btc-200k-odds-are-slimmer-than-alien-discovery/"">confirming</a> alien life in 2025 were higher than Bitcoin reaching $200,000, especially during periods of extreme market stress.</p>
<p>While the platform has seen rapid growth and occasional large payouts, it has also faced scrutiny over concerns related to manipulation and the potential misuse of insider information.</p>
<p>According to a recent study by researchers at Columbia University, transaction patterns on Polymarket indicative of wash trading began rising in July 2024 and peaked at nearly 60% of reported volume in December of the same year. Researchers <a href=""https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=5714122"">found</a> that the activity continued through late April 2025, and later climbed again to about 20% of volume in early October 2025.</p>

<p>This development comes as the agency, led by Chair Michael S. Selig, continues to indicate that his administration plans to adopt a more permissive approach to regulating the digital asset industry.</p>
<h2>IAC Appointee List Announced</h2>
<p>Of the 35 members <a href=""https://x.com/ChairmanSelig/status/2022074495591493990?s=20"">making up</a> the panel, 20 are tied to companies involved in crypto, while at least five are involved in prediction markets. Among them are Crypto.com CEO Kris Marszalek, Gemini co-founder Tyler Winklevoss, Kalshi CEO Tarek Mansour, and Polymarket architect Shayne Coplan.</p>
<blockquote><p>“Today marks an important and energizing moment at the CFTC as the Innovation Advisory Committee takes shape,” <a href=""https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/9182-26"">said</a> Selig in a Thursday press release.</p></blockquote>
<p>Additional members include Anchorage Digital&#8217;s top executive, Nathan McCauley, Grayscale&#8217;s Peter Mintzberg, Robinhood CEO Vladimir Tenev, Solana&#8217;s Anatoly Yakovenko, as well as Ripple chief Brad Garlinghouse, and Coinbase&#8217;s Brian Armstrong.</p>
<p>Executives at Paradigm, DraftKings, and the Depository Trust &amp; Clearing Corporation (DTCC) were also included, together with representatives from traditional finance institutions such as Cboe, CME, Nasdaq, and the Options Clearing Corporation (OCC), among other firms.</p>
<p>Selig said the main aim is to ensure America remains the home to the most transparent and well-regulated financial markets in the world.</p>
<blockquote><p> “By bringing together participants from every corner of the marketplace, the IAC will be a major asset for the Commission as we work to modernize our rules and regulations for the innovations of today and tomorrow,” he added.</p></blockquote>
<h2>Market Innovation and Crypto Regulation Streamlining</h2>
<p>The IAC, launched in January, replaces the Technology Advisory Committee (TAC), which previously provided guidance on how emerging technologies were affecting derivatives markets.</p>
<p>The new body will serve as a resource on developments in derivatives and commodity markets, helping the Commission assess how innovations such as artificial intelligence (AI) and blockchain are reshaping financial systems and informing the development of adaptive regulatory frameworks.</p>
<p>The CFTC has also begun coordinating with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) through a joint initiative known as “Project Crypto.”</p>
<p>The effort is <a href=""https://cryptopotato.com/sec-and-cftc-relaunch-project-crypto-to-clarify-digital-asset-regulation/"">aimed</a> at harmonizing regulatory approaches to digital asset markets, reducing jurisdictional overlap between the agencies, and providing clearer and more predictable rules for cryptocurrency companies operating in America.</p>

CryptoPotato,Bitcoin Shorts Hit August 2024 Levels as Funding Rates Sink Deeply Negative,https://cryptopotato.com/bitcoin-shorts-hit-august-2024-levels-as-funding-rates-sink-deeply-negative/,2026-02-13 17:23:05,"After recent liquidations, traders have piled into shorts again, pushing Bitcoin funding rates deeper into negative territory.","<p>Aggregated funding rate data across major cryptocurrency exchanges revealed that the current wave of short positioning is the most extreme since August 2024, a period that coincided with a major bottom for Bitcoin, according to new analysis from Santiment.</p>
<p>At that time, funding rates sank deeply into negative territory as traders overwhelmingly positioned for further downside, amidst intense fear and bearish sentiment across the market.</p>
<h2>Extreme Bear Bets Before 2024 Reversal</h2>
<p>Instead of continuing lower, Santiment <a href=""https://x.com/santimentfeed/status/2022010032728993844"">found</a> that prices reversed sharply, and the forced unwinding of overcrowded short positions helped fuel a strong recovery. Following that August 2024 low, Bitcoin went on to climb roughly 83% over the next four months. The move illustrated how extreme negative funding conditions can emerge right before powerful rebounds.</p>
<p>Santiment explained that funding rates are a mechanism within perpetual futures markets, and are designed to keep futures prices aligned with spot prices. These rates represent small, periodic payments exchanged between traders. When funding is negative, short sellers pay long traders, and when it is positive, long traders pay shorts.</p>
<p>When aggregated funding rates across exchanges fall far below zero, it means that a major share of market participants is heavily positioned for declining prices, often driven by fear, uncertainty, and doubt. Such imbalances can create conditions ripe for sharp counter-moves.</p>
<p>Many short positions are opened using leverage, meaning traders borrow capital to amplify potential gains. If prices move higher instead of lower, losses on these leveraged shorts can accumulate rapidly. Once losses breach predefined thresholds, exchanges automatically liquidate those positions to manage risk.</p>
<p>When large numbers of shorts are forced to close simultaneously, the resulting wave of buying can accelerate price increases, a trend commonly referred to as a short squeeze. The deeper funding rates fall into negative territory, the more crowded short positions become, and the greater the potential fuel for a sudden reversal.</p>
<h2>Aftermath of October Binance Liquidations</h2>
<p>The analytics platform also pointed to recent market activity surrounding a liquidation event on Binance on October 10, 2025, when a wave of long liquidations <a href=""https://cryptopotato.com/what-really-happened-in-the-crypto-market-in-october-binance-offers-insights/"">contributed</a> to a sharp drop in BTC&#8217;s price. In the aftermath of that move, traders increasingly <a href=""https://cryptopotato.com/the-bear-market-signal-this-bitcoin-indicator-just-flashed-red-after-3-years/"">shifted</a> into short positions as they expected further downside, which ended up recreating a similar imbalance that could be observed through funding rate data.</p>
<p>Current aggregated metrics suggest sentiment has once again leaned heavily in one direction. While Santiment stated that heavy short positioning does not guarantee an immediate rally, it described the present environment as one of high risk, where positioning pressure could flip into rapid upside volatility if shorts are forced to unwind.</p>
<p>Based on broader sentiment indicators, it added that these short positions are unlikely to close voluntarily. This makes a liquidation-driven move higher a more probable resolution.</p>

<p>Somewhat surprisingly, Pi Network&#8217;s PI has defied the bearish environment, posting a daily gain of around 8%.</p>
<h2>Finally in Green</h2>
<p>Pi Network&#8217;s native cryptocurrency has been in a sharp decline over the past several months, disappointing its huge base of proponents and investors. Just a few days ago, its price <a href=""https://cryptopotato.com/pi-networks-price-sees-another-all-time-low-but-next-3-days-could-be-even-worse-details/"">dropped</a> to a new all-time low of around $0.13, while its market cap plunged to around $1.1 billion.</p>
<p>Over the last 24 hours, though, the bulls stepped in, and PI reached almost $0.15. Its capitalization once again surpassed $1.3 billion, making it the 55th-largest cryptocurrency.</p>
<figure class=""wp-caption aligncenter"" id=""attachment_1428762"" style=""width: 841px;""><a href=""https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/PI-Price-1.png""><img alt=""PI Price"" class=""wp-image-1428762 size-full"" height=""577"" src=""https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/PI-Price-1.png"" width=""841"" /></a><figcaption class=""wp-caption-text"" id=""caption-attachment-1428762"">PI Price, Source: CoinGecko</figcaption></figure>
<p>The notable resurgence comes shortly after the team behind the project <a href=""https://cryptopotato.com/pi-network-announces-major-upgrades-with-feb-15-deadline-what-pioneers-need-to-know/"">provided</a> an update on its Node infrastructure. The developers revealed that the Pi Mainnet blockchain protocol is undergoing a series of improvements and set a deadline of February 15 for the first upgrade.</p>
<p>The Core Team explained that it will run the consensus algorithm with Pioneers who have applied to become Nodes and have successfully installed all required blockchain software on their computers.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;While our hope is to include as many Pioneers as possible when defining the Node requirements, the availability and reliability of individual nodes in the network affect the safety and liveness of the network,&#8221; the official announcement reads.</p></blockquote>
<p>PI&#8217;s price revival also coincides with a slowdown in token unlocks. Approximately 19 million coins are scheduled for release today (February 13), marking the record day for the next 30 days. Towards the end of the month, the daily unlocks are expected to drop below 5 million, which could reduce selling pressure and help stabilize the price.</p>

<h2>The Recent Rumors</h2>
<p>Earlier this month, some X users <a href=""https://cryptopotato.com/pi-networks-pi-crashed-to-new-atl-but-this-metric-signals-more-downside-ahead/"">speculated</a> that Kraken is preparing to allow trading services with PI. Such support from one of the leading crypto exchanges would likely have a positive price impact on the asset, as it would increase its liquidity and availability and improve its reputation.</p>
<p>Perhaps the biggest boost will be if Binance decides to embrace PI. The world&#8217;s largest crypto exchange was expected to do so last year and even <a href=""https://cryptopotato.com/binance-listing-pi-token-soon-community-has-the-final-say/"">held</a> a community vote to determine whether its users wanted the token listed on the platform.

Many altcoins collapsed by 20-30% daily, reaching new local lows.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, BTC bounced off on that day by $12,000 and tapped $72,000 in what became one of its most impressive single-day recovery attempts. However, the predominant bearish trend resumed rapidly, and BTC was stopped and driven down to $68,000 during the weekend.</p>
<p>It spent the next several days trading sideways between that lower boundary and $72,000. After the latest rejection at the upper boundary, the bears initiated another leg down, pushing the cryptocurrency south to $66,000 on Wednesday and $65,000 on Thursday.</p>
<p>The past few hours were slightly more positive for bitcoin, especially since the US CPI numbers for January came out and <a href=""https://cryptopotato.com/us-cpi-data-for-january-shows-cooling-inflation-how-will-bitcoins-price-react/"">showed</a> that inflation has actually cooled off. BTC jumped to $67,600 but was stopped there and now trades inches above $66,000. This means that BTC now sits at approximately the same spot as last week, but many alts have produced more substantial volatility.</p>
<p>On the one hand, XRP, BNB, HYPE, and SOL are deep in the red, but on the other, BCH, XMR, and HBAR have surged by up to 9.5%.</p>

<p>The Core CPI, which excludes more volatile sectors like food and energy, matched the expectations at 2.5%. Nevertheless, analysts indicated that the monthly increase in the regular CPI of just 0.2% is the lowest since last May.</p>
<p>Heather Long, Navy Federal Credit Union&#8217;s chief economist, noted that the prices for gas, used cars, and medical care all decreased in January, which helped bring down inflation even as utilities and transportation rose.</p>
<p>She determined that this is good news on the inflation front, even though there might be &#8220;one more bump from tariffs.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bitcoin&#8217;s price has usually been volatile when the US CPI data comes out. The first minutes have been rather positive, as the asset rose slightly to $67,600 before it corrected to $67,200 as of press time.</p>
<p>A more significant impact is expected once the US Federal Reserve weighs in on this data for its next move in terms of interest rate reduction.</p>
